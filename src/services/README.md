# Services

Files linked with the Redux.
The `services` directory **should only includes**:

-   action creators
-   action types
-   reducers
-   selectors
-   [sagas](sagas/README.md)
-   utilities (optional - doesn't have be part of the services directory)

Constants (not talking about actionTypes) and configurations should be placed separately, they aren't part of Redux.
